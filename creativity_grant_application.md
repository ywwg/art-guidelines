hazards or danger to the environment? Please include a detailed safety plan if the project requires structural,
combustible, or other qualities of risk.Some large-scale art, or projects utilizing fire, for example, may be subject to
greater scrutiny/further questions from the Art Grant Review Committee. ANY Art that incorporates fire MUSTbe reviewed
by the Fire Core. For further ideas about safety of public art, please see:
